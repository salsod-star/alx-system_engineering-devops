# Alx-System_engineerring-devops
Getting into the real work starting from today, we are tasked with writing a series of script files and converting them into executable files
## Requirements 

- Allowed editors: `vi, vim, emacs`
- All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All your scripts should be exactly two lines long ($ wc -l file should print 2)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/bin/bash`
- A `README.md` file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of this project, describing what each script is doing
- You are not allowed to use backticks, `&&, || or ;`
- All your scripts must be executable. To make your file executable, use the `chmod` command: `chmod u+x file`. Later, weâ€™ll learn more about how to utilize this command.

## List of commands used
some of the commands used are the listed below:
```
ls
cd 
pwd
